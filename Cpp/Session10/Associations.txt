Association: 
    class Bar {};

    class FOO 
    {
        void Bar(Bar bar);
    }


Aggregation: 
    I have an object which I 've borrowed from someone else.
    When Foo dies, Bar may live on.

    class Bar {} ;

    class Foo 
    {
        Bar bar;
            Foo(const Bar& bar) 
            {
                bar = bar;
            }
    };


Composition: 
    I own an object and I an responsible for its lifetime.
    When Foo dies, so does Bar

    class Bar {};

    class Foo 
    {
        private:
            Bar *bar new Bar();
    };
