Raw Pointers Problems:
1. Memory Leak: When using new without delete [crash]
2. Dangling Pointer: using a pointer that points to a deleted object [undefined behavior]
3. double delete: [undefined behavior]


Solution: Smart Pointers
1. Unique Smart Pointers:
    Helps in: 1. Creation of Objects
            2. Automatic Deletion of Objects, delete after new
            3. Ownership, can't be copied or assigned
    Can only be moved: cuts the original connection and establishes a new connection, stealing.
    Move performs static casting.

2. 


static keyword: static global variable and static function can only be used inside file
extern can't be used, and moves the data from stack to the data section
